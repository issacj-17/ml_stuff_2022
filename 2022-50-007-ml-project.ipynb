above results, we can see that the random initialisation of `w` and `b` has improved the performance of the gradient descent algorithm. However, we have noted that varying the design of the gradient descent algorithm at this stage has minimal effect on the model performance.\n","\n","Upon inspection of the training dataset, we have noted that the training data is extremely sparse. Hence, we need to incorporate the idea of momentum and adaptive learning rate into our gradient descent algorithm. The introduction of momentum is to ensure that the gradient descent algorithm moves in the direction of the trend (weighted average of gradients) even in the presence of anomalous gradient values or zero gradient values. This would help accelerate the training process.\n","\n","Additionally, as a result of sparse data, we require an adaptive learning rate that is able to boost the respective parameters of `w_i` and `b` appropriately such that the algorithm is more sensitive to valuable data that are present within the training set. This would help improve the correction and accelerate the training process.\n","\n","Based on the 2 requirements, we have decided to use the `AdamW` optimiser, which uses a combination of momentum and RMSProp. Moreover, `AdamW` is an improvement over the `Adam` optimiser, in that it supports regularisation by introducing a Weight Decay component to the gradient descent algorithm. This is necessary due to the use of adaptive learning rate that skews the regularisation of parameters in the `Adam` optimiser.\n","\n","Likewise, we will introduce 3 different variants of the `AdamW` optimiser. \\\n","    1.

we observe that the KernelPCA offers comparable performance to PCA. However, it is significantly slower than PCA (e.g. KernelPCA  (n=1000) took a total of `1003.68s` for dimensionality reduction and training 2 models. It also enabled Model 6 to achieve a Macro-F1 score of `0.68600` while PCA (n=1000) took a total of `166.69s` for dimensionality reduction and training 4 models. It also enabled Model 6 to achieve a Macro-F1 score of  `0.68342`). Hence, using PCA is sufficient in improving our model performance compared to KernelPCA  while reducing computational time. KernelPCA is computationally expensive to use while providing minimal improvement in performance. Perhaps, we could consider using the Nystroem method to approximate a kernel map of the training data for evaluation."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["We will now try different kernels and evaluate the model performance.
